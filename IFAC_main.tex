\section{Introduction}
Multi-agent systems (MASs) are nowadays used in a variety of applications from as
they can perform complex tasks, which would otherwise impossible for a single robot.
This is even more the case when considering heterogeneous fleet where the strenghts
of one type of robot can compensate for the limitations of another.
For example, to monitor a large area, multiple ground agents can move from one point 
to another being supervised from above by a drone with a wide field of view.
To deepen the subject and understand both the potential tasks and challenges of MASs,
the reader can refer to the work of~\cite{Maldonado2024}.

One of the fundamental cooperative tasks when working with multi-agents is formation
control.
This topic has been studied for years.
For example, already~\cite{LEE200985} already proposed
a decentralized control algorithm for a team of two-wheeled robots 
to achieve achieve a geometric pattern.
However, formation control remains an hot challenging topic to this day.
\cite{TRAN2021100117} experimentally validated a robust distributed control 
based on negative imaginary systems consensus theory, using both ground robots and
an air-ground fleet.
In the work of~\cite{GULER2023105492}, each agent computes its control action 
in a leader-follower manner using local extended Kalman filter's estimates to 
achieve a desired shape together with other wheeled robots and a drone.
An optimal distributed formation control algorithm for double-integrator multi-agents
has been presented and validated through simulations by~\cite{Huang2023}.
\cite{Aditya2023} defined the formation problem for a group of double-integrator agents 
as a discrete-time game whose solution is given by a state-dependent Riccati equation.
A robust distributed consensus controller is presented by~\cite{Restrepo2023}
to address the rendezvous problem and applied in simulation to a swarm of drones.
In the recent years, reinforcement learning has used in many areas including 
formation control. 
\cite{WANG20208150} addressed multi-particle formation control by combining 
graph attention networks and multiple long short-term memories to achieve the 
desired shape and avoid collisions respectively.
A position and an orientation robust controllers based on reinforcement learning 
are proposed and validated through simulations by~\cite{Zhong2025} for the formation 
of a term of quadrotors.

In this context is placed this work which proposes a novel formation control scheme
for a team consisting of a quadcopter and two unicycles, as show in Fig.~\ref{fig:summary_image}.

\end{figure}
When addressing the multi-agent formation, there are two main challenges to solve: 
achieving the desired shape and avoiding collisions.
On one hand, for the first challenge, a distributed controller combining Feedback 
Linearization (FL) and an optimal linear controller based on Linear Matrix 
Inequalities (LMIs) is presented.
LMIs are a powerful mathematical tool used in many applications among which also 
formation control.
In the work of~\cite{Trejo2023}, an LMI is solved to design the controller 
and observer gains, guaranteeing stable formation flight for a group of quadcopters.
~\cite{Deshpande2011} propose a formation control with artificial 
fixed delays for multiple double-integrators and 
verify the asymptotic stability of the scheme by checking 
the solvability of an LMI.
~\cite{Semsar2009} present an LMI formulation of the LQR problem 
to guarantee stable state consensus with an optimal control effort 
in a multi-agent system.
On the other end, to avoid collision avoidance, the chosen solution is 
Artificial Potential Field (APF).
In analogy with a particle moving in an electrostatic or gravitational
field, virtual repulsive force fields are simulated to ward off the robot
from an obstacle.
This approach has been widely used in formation control of ground vehicles,
see for example the work of~\cite{Yongshen2018}.
However, in more recent works, e.g.~\cite{HAN2024106105} and~\cite{Piet2025Control},
APFs are employed to navigate around obstacles and prevent collisions 
while attaining the desired shape.

This paper represents the continuation of the previous work by~\cite{Morando2025SOSE},
where a control architecture combining Feedback Linerarization (FL), 
a robust LMI-based controller and APFs was proposed 
and validated through simulations for 
the formation of three unicycles.
The successive developments sought to manage the challenge
of a heterogeneous team (replacing a ground vehicle with a quadcopter)
by adapting the methodology and then experimentally validating 
the new solution.
The contributions of this work are: a) a controller involving FL, a LMI-based controller and APFs 
is presented for the stable formation of an air-ground fleet;
b) the proposed controller has been validated through MATLAB Simulink
simulations and a comprensive set of experiments, including both static
and dynamic obstacle scenarios.
The remainder paper is structured as follows. 
In Section~\ref{sec:heterogeneous_fleet_modeling}, 
the mathematical model used to describe the team is stated.
The proposed formation controller is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:formation_controller}.
The simulations and experiments results are reported and analyzed
in Section~\ref{sec:simulation_results} and 
in Section~\ref{sec:experimental_validation} respectively.
Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
